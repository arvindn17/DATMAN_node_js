# Datman Technical Question -


# What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

  I would like to add following point if I had more time
   - Api authentication 
   - Code documentation
   - Code optimization  
   - Added negative test cases for unit test
   - Implemented ACID on TRANSACTION 
   
# What's your favourite programming language? Why?

I like php because it make easy to develop, deploy for webapplication. It's an opensource, fast and able to provide quick delivery of application.

# How would you track down a performance bottleneck in an application? Have you ever had to do this?

My approach to find performance bottleneck in an application is based on devide and conquer strategy. yes, i did and resolve it by use of proper indexing in mysql db.

# How would you deploy your API in a production environment?

I would use CI/ CD to deploy api in production:
CI would be responsible for 
- Development branch : each developer work in their respective branch
- Test: Testing of developed task.
- Merge : Merge development branch to master.

CD would be responsible for automatic deployment from repository. Most widely tool used in CI/CD are Github and Jenkins.
